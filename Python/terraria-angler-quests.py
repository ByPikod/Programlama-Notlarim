#   This is a code that I made to learn how many times I should
#   complete the Angler quest in Terraria. It's a quest that you should
#   catch a specific fish and take it to the Angler. Which he is a fisherman boy.
#   In return, he gives some items. There is 6 neccessary items you should collect.
#   There is 6 neccessary items you should collect.
#   I've calculcated the avarage amount of quests you should complete to collect 6 items.
